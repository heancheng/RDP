TinyThread++ 实现了C++0x 线程管理类库的一个兼容子集。

Portable Threads

Need portable threads for your C++ app? Is C++11 unavailable for your target compiler(s)? Is Boost too large?

Then you need TinyThread++!

TinyThread++ implements a fairly compatible subset of the C++11 thread management classes.
Features
Open source!
Very portable (it has been tested under Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, OpenSolaris and FreeBSD, and should work under most POSIX compatible systems).
Fairly faithful to the C++11 standard (see the January 2012 draft: N3337, chapter 30).
Minimalistic (no external dependencies, and easy to include in a project).
Minimal overhead ― most functions generate compact inline code.
As a bonus, the library includes a very fast user space mutex class (fast_mutex).
